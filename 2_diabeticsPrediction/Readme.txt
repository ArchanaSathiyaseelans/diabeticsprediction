In this Project, we build a machine learning system using support vector machines to predict diabetes. We preprocess the data, split it into training and testing sets, train the model, and evaluate its accuracy. We also create a predictive system using input data to determine if a person has diabetes.

Steps involved:

 ⚙️ Importing libraries and dependencies

📚 Loading and analyzing the sonar data

➡️ Splitting the data into training and test sets

 🧠 Training the logistic regression model

✔️ Evaluating the model's accuracy on training and test data

 🔮 Building a predictive system to classify whether the person is diabetic or not



🧪 We build a machine learning system to predict diabetes using support vector machines. Support Vector Machine (SVM) is an important algorithm in supervised learning for classification tasks. It plots data in a graph and finds a hyperplane to separate different classes.

🔄 We preprocess the data, standardize it, and split it into training and testing sets. Data preprocessing is crucial, involving analysis, standardization, and splitting data into training and test sets. Standardizing data ensures all attributes are in the same range for accurate predictions.

📊 We train the support vector machine model and evaluate its accuracy on the training and testing data. Evaluating accuracy scores on both training and test data helps assess the model's performance. An accuracy score above 75% indicates a good model.

➡️ We create a predictive system using input data to determine if a person has diabetes. The trained SVM model can be used to predict whether a person has diabetes or not based on medical information like glucose level, insulin level, BMI, etc.
